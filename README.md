# Indian Loan Document Tagger

A simple web-based tool built with Python and Streamlit to automatically classify and tag Indian secured loan documents (e.g., Sale Deed, PAN Card, Bank Statements) from uploaded PDF and image files.

-----

Features

  * Multi-File Upload: Accepts multiple PDF and image files (`.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`).
  * OCR Text Extraction: Uses Tesseract-OCR to extract text from all documents.
  * Keyword-Based Classification: Automatically tags documents based on predefined keywords.
  * Application Summary: Provides a clear summary of which required documents are missing or duplicated.
  * Simple Web Interface: Built with Streamlit for ease of use.

-----

Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

1.  Python 3.8+: [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2.  Tesseract-OCR: The optical character recognition engine.
      * Windows: Download from [Tesseract at UB Mannheim](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki).
      * macOS: `brew install tesseract`
3.  Poppler: A PDF rendering library.
      * Windows: Download the latest zip from [Poppler for Windows](https://github.com/oschwartz10612/poppler-windows/releases/) and unzip it to a permanent location (e.g., `C:\poppler`).
      * macOS: `brew install poppler`

 Setup & Installation

1.  Clone the repository (or download the `app.py` file):

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
    cd your-repository-name
    ```

2.  Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:

    ```txt
    streamlit
    pytesseract
    pdf2image
    Pillow
    pandas
    ```

3.  Install the Python libraries:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  Configure Paths in `app.py` (For Windows Users):
    If you are on Windows, you must update `app.py` to point to your Tesseract and Poppler installations.

    ```python
    # For Windows, you must provide the exact paths.
    pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r'C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe'
    POPPLER_PATH = r'C:\poppler\poppler-24.02.0-win-x86_64\bin' # Update this path to your Poppler 'bin' folder
    ```

    macOS users can usually leave these settings as they are in the final script.

How to Run

1.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
2.  Navigate to the project directory.
3.  Run the following command:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
4.  Your web browser will automatically open with the application running.

 ðŸ”§ Tech Stack

  * Language: Python
  * Web Framework: Streamlit
  * OCR: Pytesseract
  * PDF Handling: pdf2image, Poppler
  * Image Handling: Pillow
  * Data Manipulation: Pandas

Future Improvements

  * Improve Accuracy with Regex: Use regular expressions to find specific patterns (like PAN numbers or Aadhaar numbers) for more reliable classification.
  * Introduce Machine Learning: For higher accuracy, train a simple classifier model (e.g., Naive Bayes or a small transformer) on a labeled dataset of documents.
  * Add Caching: Implement Streamlit's caching decorators (`@st.cache_data`) to prevent reprocessing of the same file, speeding up the user experience.
